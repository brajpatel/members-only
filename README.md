This app was created for The Odin Project's [Authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs#authentication) section in the NodeJS Course. The main objectives of this project were:
- authenticating users
- giving users different abilities and permissions
</br></br>
## About
The app follows the theme of a game collection that users can create, read, update and delete items, such as games, and categories such as developers, platforms and genres.
</br></br>
These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Using bootstrap classes to style elements
- Working with Multer to display images uploaded by the user
